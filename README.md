A daily algorithm of various data-structures problems written in typescript

1. Maze problem
   You're given a matrix (2d-Array) of 0s and 1s. The 1s represent the cells that do not have walls, while 0s cells have walls.
   Given a source cell & destination cell, find the shortest path that can be tarversed from the source to destination, if ever there is a path  exists.
   
   Solution A: Breadth-First Search --> a) uni-directional path b) bi-directional path
